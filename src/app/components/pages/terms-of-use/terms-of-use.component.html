        <p style="font: small"><strong>Last Revised: July 4, 2020</strong></p>
      </div>


      <p>By accessing or using the GNEISS (Global Network Encryption Investment Security Service) website located at
        https://gneiss.io (the “Site”) and any services made available through the Site (collectively, the “Services”),
        you (“User”) agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (“Terms”). The Services are owned and controlled by GNEISS
        Foundation (“GNEISS”), and the terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to GNEISS Foundation. These Terms affect your
        legal rights and obligations. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, do not access or use the Services.
      </p>


      <p>GNEISS reserves the right to change or modify the terms and conditions contained in these Terms, including but
        not limited to any policy or guideline of the Site, at any time and at its sole discretion. We will provide
        notice of these changes by posting the revised Terms to the Site and changing the "Last Revised" date at the top
        of the Terms, or by emailing users at their provided email addresses, or by any other means as determined by
        GNEISS. The decision of which notification chosen will be left to GNEISS's sole discretion. Using a particular
        form of notice in some instances does not obligate us to use the same form in other instances. Any changes or
        modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions to the Site or at the instant that GNEISS
        transmits the information to the users (e.g. via email). These changes will apply at that instant to all then
        current and subsequent uses of the Site. You waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such
        changes or modifications. Your continued use of this Site acts as acceptance of such changes or modifications.
        If you do not agree to the Terms in effect when you access or use the Site, you must stop using the Site.</p>

      <h3>PREAMBLE<br></h3>
      <p>GNEISS provides an online tool (the “Platform”) that allows users to freely create, trade, and store
        crypto-assets and smart contracts.</p>

        Policy or required to do so by common law enforcement, Court of Record order, or in compliance with legal
        reporting obligations.</p>



      <h2>4. CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET</h2>
      <p>The transmission of data or information (including communications by e-mail) over the Internet or other
        publicly accessible networks is not one hundred percent secure, and is subject to possible loss, interception,
        or alteration while in transit. Accordingly, GNEISS does not assume any liability, without limitation, for any
        damage you may experience or costs you may incur as a result of any transmissions over the Internet or other
        publicly accessible networks, including but not limited to transmissions involving the Platform or e-mail with
        GNEISS containing your personal information. While GNEISS will take commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard
        the privacy of the information you provide to GNEISS and will treat such information in accordance with GNEISS's
        Privacy Policy, in no event will the information you provide to GNEISS be deemed to be confidential, create any
        fiduciary obligations for GNEISS, or result in any liability for GNEISS in the event that such information is
        negligently released by GNEISS or accessed by third parties without GNEISS's consent.</p>


      <h2>5. GNEISS DOES NOT PROVIDE INVESTING ADVICE</h2>
      <p>We are an execution-only service and do not advise on the merits of any particular transactions or their
        taxation consequences. In entering into any transaction on the Platform, you represent that you have been, are,
        and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of
        the transaction. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice
        and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction. We give you no warranty
        as to the suitability of the cryptocurrencies traded under these Terms and assume no fiduciary duty in our
        relations with you.</p>
      <p>If at any point GNEISS or its representatives do provide trading recommendations, market commentary, or any
        other information, the act of doing so is incidental to your relationship with us and imposes no obligation of
        truth or due diligence on behalf of GNEISS or its representatives. We give no representation, warranty, or
        guarantee as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information or as to the tax consequences of any
        transaction.</p>

Any other use of the Services or Content is expressly prohibited. All other rights in the Platform or Content are reserved by us and our licensors.

      <h2>8. 51% AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCY ATTACKS</h2>
      <p>GNEISS makes every commercially reasonable attempt to help prevent and mitigate cryptocurrency attacks. If
        GNEISS is able to confirm that a cryptocurrency active on the Platform has been compromised or is under attack,
        GNEISS may immediately halt trading, deposits, and withdrawals for such cryptocurrency. If it is determined that
        such an attack caused the cryptocurrency to greatly decrease in value, GNEISS may discontinue trade activity on
        such cryptocurrency entirely. Resolutions concerning deposits, withdrawals, and user balances for an attacked
        cryptocurrency will be determined on a case-by-case basis. GNEISS makes no representation and does not warrant
        the safety of the Platform and is not liable for any lost value or stolen property, whether or not GNEISS was
        negligent in providing the proper security.</p>

      <h2>9. (AML) Anti-Money Laundering & (KYC) Know Your Customer Policy</h2>
      <p>GNEISS protects itself from involvement in any activity that facilitates money laundering or other criminal
        activities by following the FinCEN guidance for MSB’s operating in the United States.</p>
      <p>GNEISS aims to reasonably identify each user by cross-checking user data against governmental watch lists such
        as OFAC, as well as 3rd party identity verification and authentication services. If a user or a user’s
        transaction is flagged as suspicious through our internal controls, GNEISS will require additional proof of
        identification from the user and has the right to not permit any trades, deposits, and/or withdrawals until
        additional and verifiable proof of identity is received and the Compliance Officer has approved the user for use
        of the Platform.</p>
      <p>By agreeing to our Terms, you acknowledge and understand that GNEISS maintains verification levels which
        require user participation and verification in order to obtain, with leveled permissions based on user-supplied
        information, our ability to verify it, and our internal policies. You accept that you may not be able to achieve
        a desired level of verification, and GNEISS reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, the
        appropriate Verification Level for any user, as well as the right to downgrade users without prior notice.
        GNEISS may, from time to time, implement policies restricting Verification Levels by nationality, country of
        residence, or any other factor. This may affect your ability to withdraw funds in your account and you indemnify
        GNEISS against any losses associated with an inability to deposit and/or withdraw funds based on your
        verification level.</p>

      <h2>10. THIRD PARTY CONTENT</h2>
      <p>GNEISS and its users may provide third party content on the Site and may provide links to web pages and content
        that are not owned or controlled by GNEISS (collectively the "Third Party Content") as a service to those
        interested in this information. GNEISS does not control, endorse, or adopt any Third Party Content and makes no
        representation or warranties of any kind regarding the Third Party Content, including but not limited to its

        any Third Party Content and undertakes no responsibility to update or review any Third Party Content. You
        acknowledge that your use of such Third Party Content is at your own risk. Your business dealings or
        correspondence with, or participation in promotions of, any third parties, and any terms, conditions,
        warranties, or representations associated with such dealings or promotions, are solely between you and such
